This repository contains the source code for various BepInEx plugins that I have made for the game [ULTRAKILL](http://devilmayquake.com/).
Before building, create the `libs` directory in the project's main directory, then copy the required dependencies from ULTRAKILL's `ULTRAKILL_Data/Managed` folder into that directory.
